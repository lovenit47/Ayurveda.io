                <P>
                    Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. It originated over 5000 years ago, and is even more relevant today than ever before. <br><br>
                    Unlike Western medicine, Ayurveda is a holistic science and looks at wellness as a whole: perfect health is defined as a state of balance between mind, body, spirit, and social well-being. <br><br>
                    Rather than treating only the symptoms, Ayurveda focuses on finding and treating the root cause of disease. <br><br>

                    Any type of disease (whether that is physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual) is caused by an imbalance (more about imbalances later). Thousands of years of Ayurvedic knowledge and wisdom have been documented in ancient scriptures, the most revered one being the Charaka Samhita. <br><br>

                    Being a holistic science, Ayurveda can help you balance and improve several aspects of your life, including (but not limited to): <br>

                    At its root, <b>the Ayurvedic philosophy helps you to:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Naturally synchronise with your truest self</li>
                        <li>Nurture and nourish your mind, body and spirit equally</li>
                        <li>Improve your sense of well-being</li>

                        The concept of <b> 'being in balance'</b> is an integral and the core principle in Ayurveda which guides every other facet and even determines your relationship with this science. <b> Perfect health, according to Ayurveda, is a balance between the body, mind, soul, and social wellbeing.</b> Every thought and practice in this system, therefore, mirrors the dual principles of balance and connection.<br><br>

                            In fact, Ayurveda is best characterized as the science of living <b>in tune with nature's laws. </b>Ayurvedic philosophy of natural and holistic medicine encourages people to live a balanced existence by making healthy and natural lifestyle adjustments. <br><br>

                            Ayurveda's age-old knowledge is just as applicable or maybe <b>even more relevant today as it was in the ancient times.</b> <br>

            <p>As such, all Ayurvedic principles and practices are based on the concept of <b> 5 fundamental </b>elements that are the building blocks of nature-namely</p>
            <img src="5elements.webp" alt="">
            <p>Ayurveda recognizes these foundational elements as key lenses through which the entire scope of its philosophy can be viewed as these in turn, come together to form the 3 doshas. </p>

            <p>According to Ayurvedic philosophy, everyone is born with a <b>unique constitution</b> known as <b>Prakruti</b>.The Prakruti is a <b>unique combination of physical and psychological traits</b> that determine how each individual works. It is established from conception. <br><br><br>
                
            Each person's unique Prakruti, or constitution, is made up of <b> three qualities known as Doshas.</b> Ayurvedic ideology holds that <b>the 5 natural elements of nature come together to form the 3 doshas,</b> each of which has a distinct influence on body processes. <br><br><br>

            <p>
                The unique constituent with which you're born is your natural state of body and mind. An individual's fundamental prakruti 
                
                <b>remains constant throughout their lives.</b><br><br>

                However, internal, external, and environmental variables <b>like day and night, seasonal changes, nutrition, lifestyle choices, </b>and more have an impact on one's prakruti that results in ailments, diseases and other visible symptoms.<br><br>

                The doshas are biological energies that may be found throughout the human body and mind. <b> They regulate bodily and mental functions </b> and give each living creature a unique blueprint for <b>health, happiness and fulfilment.</b> <br><br>

                Ayurveda, therefore, emphasizes <b>sickness prevention</b> and advocates <b>sustaining health</b> by adhering to daily and seasonal routines that help you regain the balanced constituent with which you were born.<br><br>

                Therefore, like all holistic health systems, Ayurveda focuses on the unshakable connections between the body, mind, and spirit. However, as you can see, Ayurveda's connectedness extends far beyond the individual, reaching into the universal. <br><br>

For example, if the aggressive and "hot" pitta-prominent individual aggravates pitta, he or she may acquire a prickly rash or have an acidic stomach. <br> <br>

                    A bad diet, too much or too little physical or mental exertion, lifestyle, pollution, aging, and other things can all contribute to an imbalance. <br> <br>

                    The whole cosmos, according to Ayurvedic philosophy, is an interaction of the five great elements' energies that form the 3 doshas: <br> <br>

                    <b>Pitta</b> is represented by <b>fire and water,</b> and it is considered to be in charge of digestion, metabolism, intellect, and skin color. Anger, hatred, and jealousy are all Pitta emotions. <br><br><br>

                    <b>Kapha</b> is represented by the <b>earth and water.</b> Kapha governs the physical structure of the body as well as the immunological system. Calmness, forgiving, love, and greed are all believed to be Kapha-controlled emotional reactions. <br> <br><br>

                    The <b>20 'Gunas'</b> or <b>qualities and traits</b>, are what Ayurveda describes all matter to possess. 

                    From substances to experiences to imbalances in dosha, these gunas give you a framework to understand and verbalize them and thereby also helps you cater to your needs more clearly. 

                    The gunas are organized into the following 10 pairs of opposites as:

                <p>
                    Ayurveda ensures that this essential list will help you be equipped to sufficiently take care of yourself. <br><br>

                    For example, if you have naturally dry skin, you're likely to experience intense dryness in the winters which will be an imbalance of the Vata dosha, that combines the space and air elements.<br><br>

                    Now, the solution?<br><br>

                    According to this list, you've got to provide enough unctuousness. And Ayurveda recommends that this doesn't just stop at oiling or moisturizing your skin, but it also extends to consuming food that is rich in healthy oils and fats and even indulging in hearty and warm experiences to fulfil your body and mind equally to pacify the excess of Vata dosha<br><br>

        <p>Beyond the doshas and their manifestations, Ayurveda also prescribes 3 basic foundations on which you can base everything in your life. These initiate better and more effective functioning and even help adapt your lifestyle to your surroundings to live in a more grounded manner. <br>
        According to Ayurveda, to enjoy optimal health and a calm state of mind, the body must be supplied with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>'Aharaa' or proper food</li>
            <li>'Nidraa' or proper sleep</li>

            <b>Ahaara - Pillar of food </b>

            <p>Eating a good, wholesome meal allows your body to rightly absorb all nutrients and eliminate all toxins. Eating right is also important as it also contributes to 'prana' or the life force that sustains life.</p>
            <p>In Ayurveda, this pillar also extends to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proper digestion and mindful consumption of food </li>
                <li>Eating food at the right time and in the right combinations, and </li>
                <li>Choosing food that suits your individual constituent type.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So, Ayurveda teaches us that paying attention to what we eat and how eat can have a significant effect on both our body and mind to attain the ultimate level of balance and harmony.

            <p>Sleep is body's natural way to heal, repair and restore energy. Ayurveda also throws light on how sleep is also the body's innate mechanism to cope and manage the chemicals and pollutants, and the stress and anxiety your mind undergoes while being awake.</p>
            <p>As with food, just getting sleep is not enough. Having a sleep routine or sleep cycle that complements your daily life and your living environment based on your specific dosha type is what helps you lead a focused and active life. </p>

                <p>Although 'Bhramacharya' literally translates to celibacy, what Ayurvedic ideology implies here is that one should have a centred approach towards life by being aware of one's thoughts and actions.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Ayurveda believes that this is necessary to prevent us from overindulging or limiting ourselves from life’s most essential activities. It also helps us conserve our energies to completing tasks that add value to our lives. Thus, it’s nothing but mastering the technique of focusing where and to what you let your energy dive into.

The use of this part of Ayurvedic knowledge was aimed not just at improving one's exterior beauty, but also at obtaining ‘aayush and aarogyam' or longevity and good health. <br><br>
            Much more than that, there is also evidence of advanced self-beautification notions and a wide range of cosmetics used by both men and women in antiquity in ancient India. The ancient Indians' conception of cosmetics and their application was based entirely on natural resources. <br><br>

            Ayurvedic skin care methods, therefore, include a variety of formulas utilizing herbs and other natural-occurring substances that make up the daily regimen for effective skincare. <br><br>

            Herbal extracts, fruit extracts, and essential oils are increasingly being employed efficiently in medications, dietary supplements, and personal care products based on Ayurveda's extensive and well-established expertise. <br><br>

                       <p style="padding: 20px;"> As you must have already guessed, the entire healing system of Ayurveda is built on the philosophy that prevention is better than cure. It's also the reason why Ayurveda stresses so much on maintaining balance and harmony as it primarily keeps diseases and ailments to a minimum. <br><br>
                        Ayurveda also tackles problems at its root cause rather than just superficially or temporarily tend to the symptoms which in turn, helps build the body's immunity response and prevents further complications.</p>
